I built the website from the given HTML snippet, added my own CSS and used JS for my animations. 
I tried to draw some stuff using CSS only and deferred from including any photos. 
The entire website was made keeping in mind some beach vibes and fun illustrations for a playful touch!

The whole process was full of ups and downs to be honest, but I did enjoy exploring my coding creativity while I also jumped, sometimes stumbled in overcoming my barriers. 
I am particularly proud of my animations and a motion path which proved to be the most difficult part of the entire project. 
I am really happy with my results as a first-time dev project and wish to do so much more in the future challenges.
